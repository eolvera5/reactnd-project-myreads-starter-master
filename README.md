# MyReads Project
This is the starter template for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. Make sure to get started on this template by accessing the src folder and make the appropriate changes/additions.The goal here is to add functionality to: Shelfs Currently Reading, Want to Read, and In Progress and change books from shelf to shelf.

#Install the Dependencies
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`

## Start Backend Server
To start or load your server, access your terminal and find your folder
$npm start once it starts running, set your browser up to  http://localhost:3000 and you should be able to view your app.

## How it works
Move the books around the shelf from clicking the drop down button on the side and select the categories: Currently Reading, Want to Read, and In Progress. You can also select the Hamburger Menu to view the different categories.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md).
